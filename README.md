# What can I find here  

The unemployment rate is high in every country which is a burden for any economy. On the other hand, companies can't find employee who meet their requirements. Trada is here as a brigde between 2 sides providing consultant, creating community and certificate the quality of applicants. People need to find suitable job not high salary job and that is our main goal.
